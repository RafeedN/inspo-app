# Inspo Generator - React App

This is a web application built using the **React framework**. Its main functionality is to generate randomized inspirational quotes for users. To accomplish this, the application makes **API requests** to fetch an array of quotes, from which a random quote is selected and displayed on the web page.

The application provides an **interactive** and **engaging** user experience, with a **simple** and **intuitive** interface. Upon loading the page or clicking a button, a new random quote is fetched and displayed dynamically, providing users with a new quote each time.
